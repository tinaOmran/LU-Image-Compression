# ðŸ“· LU-Based High-Resolution Image Compression

This project explores the use of **LU decomposition** for compressing high-resolution grayscale images, comparing its performance with standard methods such as **SVD** and **JPEG**. It was developed as part of a Numerical Linear Algebra course at Amirkabir University of Technology.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Image compression is essential for reducing storage and transmission costs while preserving visual quality. This project implements and evaluates several compression techniques:

- LU decomposition (with and without pivoting)
- LU combined with quantization and thresholding
- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
- JPEG compression
- Block-based filtering and quantization

Each method is assessed using standard image quality metrics: **PSNR** and **SSIM**.

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts

### âœ… LU Decomposition  
Used to approximate the pixel intensity matrix. Variants include:
- LU without pivoting
- LU with partial pivoting
- LU + quantization
- LU + thresholding

### ðŸ§® SVD Compression  
Keeps only the largest singular values to reduce matrix rank and compress image data.

### ðŸ§Š Quantization & Filtering  
Reduces pixel intensity levels and removes low-variance blocks to shrink image size.

### ðŸ“Š Evaluation Metrics  
- **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**: Measures reconstruction accuracy.
- **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)**: Evaluates perceptual similarity.
